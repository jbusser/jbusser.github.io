I have spent most of the last 20 years involved in Web development in
some form or another. I remember CGI.pm, SunOS 4, and NCSA HTTPd. In that
time I have both written code and managed servers. For a number of years, I
did devops, but it didn't have a name then.

Today I am technology lead at [ThinkCERCA.com](http://www.thinkcerca.com/),
an education-technology company that teaches critical-thinking skills to
elementary and high-school students. I believe in good object design and
making simple out of the complex. I don't always succeed at either,
but that's what gets me out of bed in the morning.
